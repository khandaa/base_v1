# Project cleanup

Guidelines to cleanup the project of any unwanted files and folders. 

## Implementation
1. GO through the project folder and look for unused code files. whichever files are not being actively used, mark them for deletion by updating their name as delete_<filename>
2. Show the list of files to be deleted to the user and get a confirmation before deleting.
3. remove all the unnecessary tables. 
4. If there are multiple files created to do the same work, review and delete the one that is no longer needed.
